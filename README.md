As part of a Meetup.com group called 20LetsHang, I grabbed Meetup data showing the members who brought new people to a 20LetsHang event. <br>
Meetup.com is a site where people make interest groups and organize events for groups, and people who join the groups attend the events. <br>
20LetsHang is a meetup group for people in their 20's around the South Bay Area in California.
